      "AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance . Machine learning , operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets . It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware . [ 272 ] All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China. [ 273 ] [ 274 ]\n",

      "In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo , developed by DeepMind , beat the world champion Go player . The program taught only the game's rules and developed a strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. [ 372 ] ChatGPT , launched on November 30, 2022, became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months. [ 373 ] It marked what is widely regarded as AI's breakout year, bringing it into the public consciousness. [ 374 ] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom , where large companies began investing billions of dollars in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\". [ 375 ] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022. [ 376 ] According to PitchBook research, 22% of newly funded startups in 2024 claimed to be AI companies. [ 377 ]\n",

[ 378 ] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications. [ 379 ] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will . [ 380 ] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI .

      "For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data . This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. [ 135 ] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein . [ 137 ] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria. [ 138 ] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold. [ 139 ] [ 140 ]\n",
