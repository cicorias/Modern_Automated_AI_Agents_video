      "AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision-making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware. All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China. There are many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which cannot be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours. Technological unemployment is also a concern, with economists speculating about unemployment risks from AI advancements if there is no adequate social policy for full employment. In the late 2010s and early 2020s, AGI companies began delivering programs that created enormous interest. Notable advancements include AlphaGo beating the world champion Go player in 2015 and the release of GPT-3 in 2020 by OpenAI, capable of generating high-quality human-like text. The aggressive AI boom in recent years has seen significant investments in AI research, with billions of dollars spent annually and a growing number of U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates specializing in AI. Additionally, the philosophy and ethics of AI have become intensified topics of public discussion due to rapid advancements.\n"
