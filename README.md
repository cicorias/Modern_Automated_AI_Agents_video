# AI Agents A-Z

This repository contains code for both my live course: [O'Reilly Live Online Training for AI Agents A-Z](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/ai-agents-a-z/0642572007604) and my video series: [Modern Automated AI Agents: Building Agentic AI to Perform Complex Tasks
](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/modern-automated-ai/9780135414965/)

This course provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, implementing, and managing AI agents both at the prototype stage and in production. Attendees will start with foundational concepts and progressively delve into more advanced topics, including various frameworks like CrewAI, LangChain, and AutoGen as well as building agents from scratch using powerful prompt engineering techniques. The course emphasizes practical application, guiding participants through hands-on exercises to implement and deploy AI agents, evaluate their performance, and iterate on their designs. We will go over key aspects like cost projections, open versus closed source options, and best practices are thoroughly covered to equip attendees with the knowledge to make informed decisions in their AI projects.
